Competencies
JF 1.5 Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software
I am able to locate loaded procedures within SQL Server Manager, update the code with the necessary edits and either run it on the proper server or use SQL
On the ticket assign to Bryan, Zuri and I as watcher, we met on a regular basis and did some peer programming.
Independently, I was able to locate the stored procedure, update the code to complete the specific task of running SQL code that will be called by an API within the program to update employee access to a specifc security group.
JF 6.3 Able to communicate software solutions and ideas to technical and non-technical stakeholders**
Because I had already been working with stored procedures on another group project, i was able to help assist with location of the stored procedure, how to update them and label new procs to be used by the API
In addition, I have been able to communicate to my manager how the application can be altered to benefit our sister group with their process of datasets.
