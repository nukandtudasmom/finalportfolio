## Portfolio Introduction
- Who you are
- I'd like to contribute to the world of online security. Myself and my loved ones all have a story of being hacked. Anyone who has been through the trials of some stranger stealing their personal information, knows how friegtning and confusing the situation is. I want to be part of the movement to lessen those experiences from happening. 
- The teams you have worked on : 
- Your areas of interest: I love data and automation. 

My most valuable take away from this Apprenticeship are resources. Although this was my first introduction to software engineering, I've learned some valuable processes. I've learned that I don't have to know everything and practicing truely does provide the best results. When I first started last year and someone said to me, just try different things out and see how they work, I had no clue how to do that and everything I tried just drew me further away from a successful end product. Now, I understand how to try things differently. I understand how interpret and research error messages. MOST importantly for me, I've learned that coding in an Enterprise enviremonment is much different than the projects we work on randomly. I've learned how to review the code that is already present and that I can duplicate it for the function I need it for. I've learned how to locate the API code within Swagger and understand what code should be used to update it. I've learned how to use resources such as MDN and Stackoverflow. I've also learned how to oreview a ticket and ask relevent questions pertaining to the instructions. SO! Even though I am not the best coder in the Apprecticeship, I am definately walking away with the skills to be successful.
